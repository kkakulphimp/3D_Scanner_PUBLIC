# Added because tImage on mingw sometimes gets stuck in busy-wait for tImage.
# Just opening the process's properties in Process Explorer releases the wait, somehow.
# Instead, the problem goes away if I test the small grid size against g_ompthresh.
# It appears that running OMP parallel_for...() on work that is too small
#  can cause program to stop responding under mingw.
