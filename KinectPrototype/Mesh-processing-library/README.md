# Mesh-processing-library
See [README.html](https://rawgit.com/hhoppe/Mesh-processing-library/master/README.html) for details.

C++ library and programs that demonstrate mesh processing techniques in computer graphics
published at ACM SIGGRAPH in 1992â€“1998:

* surface reconstruction (from unorganized, unoriented points)
* mesh optimization
* subdivision surface fitting
* mesh simplification
* progressive meshes (level-of-detail representation)
* geomorphs (smooth transitions across LOD meshes)
* view-dependent mesh refinement
* smooth terrain LOD
* progressive simplicial complexes
